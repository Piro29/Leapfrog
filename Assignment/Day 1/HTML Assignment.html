        <h1>Games</h1>
        <hr>
        <i>This article is about all types of games in general. For games played on a consumer electronic, see Video
            game. For other uses, see Game (disambiguation).</i>
        <p>A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an
            educational tool.
            Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more
            often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.
            However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as
            professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an
            artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).</p>

        <p>Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be
            played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals.
            The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess
            championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn
            to play.
            Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and
            who is a player. A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games
            come with present rules.</p>

                <h3>Ludwig Wittgenstein</h3>
                <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word
                    game. In his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such
                    as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define what games are. From this,
                    Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game to a range of disparate human activities that
                    bear to one another only what one might call family resemblances. As the following game definitions
                    show, this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that
                    Wittgenstein was wrong and that Bernard Suits' definition is a good answer to the problem.</p>

                <h3>Roger Caillois</h3>
                <p>French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men)(1961),
                    defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>fun</em>: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character</li>
                    <li><em>separate</em>: it is circumscribed in time and place</li>
                    <li><em>uncertain</em>: the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable</li>
                    <li><em>non-productive</em>: participation does not accomplish anything useful</li>
                    <li><em>governed by rules</em>: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life</li>
                    <li><em>fictitious</em>: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality</li>

                <h3>Chris Crawford</h3>
                <p>Game designer Chris Crawford defined the term in the context of computers. Using a series of
                    dichotomies:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and entertainment if made for money.</li>
                    <li>A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive. Movies and books are cited as
                        examples of non-interactive entertainment.
                    </li>
                    <li>If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford notes that by his
                        definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims
                        and SimCity are toys, not games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete", it is a puzzle; if there is one,
                        it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably
                        algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to
                        evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with
                        their performance, the conflict is a competition. (Competitions include racing and figure
                        skating.) However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as[original research?]: an interactive, goal-oriented
                    activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active
                    agents) can interfere with each other.</p>
                <p>Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment and games are not necessarily
                    undertaken for monetary gain.

            <h2>Gameplay elements and classification</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Games can be characterized by "what the player does". This is often referred to as gameplay.
                Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of
                game.</p>

            <article class="sub_content">
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.g. miniatures, a ball, cards, a
                    board and pieces, or a computer). In places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball
                    has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of
                    ball games such as rugby, basketball, soccer (football), cricket, tennis, and volleyball.
                    Other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for instance, have
                    unique standard decks of playing cards. Other games such as chess may be traced primarily through
                    the development and evolution of its game pieces.</p>

                <p>Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token may be a pawn on a board, play
                    money, or an intangible item such as a point scored.</p>

                <p>
                    Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is
                    defined by the environment. Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the
                    environment is altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game
                    in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even
                    with the same cars.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="sub_content">
                <h3>Rules and aims</h3>
                <p>Games are often characterized by their tools and rules. While rules are subject to variations and
                    changes, enough change in the rules usually results in a "new" game. For instance, baseball can be
                    played with "real" baseballs or with wiffleballs. However, if the players decide to play with only
                    three bases, they are arguably playing a different game.
                    There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own
                    rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules.</p>

                <p>Rules generally determine the time-keeping system, the rights and responsibilities of the players,
                    scoring techniques, preset boundaries, and each player's goals.</p>

                <p>The rules of a game may be distinguished from its aims. For most competitive games, the
                    ultimate aim is winning: in this sense, checkmate is the aim of chess. Common win conditions are
                    being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of Catan), having the
                    greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's
                    game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate). There may also be intermediate
                    aims, which are tasks that move a player toward winning. For instance, an intermediate aim in
                    football is to score goals, because scoring goals will increase one's likelihood of winning the
                    game, but isn't alone sufficient to win the game.</p>

                <h3>Skill, strategy, and chance</h3>
                <p>Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target
                    shooting, and stake, and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess. Games of strategy include
                    checkers, chess, Go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment to play them.
                    Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack, Mahjong, roulette, etc.), as well as snakes and
                    ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice. However, most games
                    contain two or all three of these elements. For example, American football and baseball involve both
                    physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance. Many
                    card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games involve mental skill, strategy, and
                    an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and
                    Carcassonne.</p>

            <h2>Types</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Games can take a variety of forms, from competitive sports to board games and video games.</p>

            <article class="sub_content">
                <h3>Sports</h3>
                <p>Many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields, leading to the involvement of a
                    community much larger than the group of players. A city or town may set aside such resources for the
                    organization of sports leagues.</p>
                <p>Popular sports may have spectators who are entertained just by watching games. A community will often
                    align itself with a local sports team that supposedly represents it (even if the team or most of its
                    players only recently moved in); they often align themselves against their opponents or have
                    traditional rivalries. The concept of fandom began with sports fans.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="sub_content">
                <h3>Tabletop games</h3>
                <p>A tabletop game is a game where the elements of play are confined to a small area and require little
                    physical exertion, usually simply placing, picking up and moving game pieces. Most of these games
                    are played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the game's elements are
                    located. However, many games falling into this category, particularly party games, are more
                    free-form in their play and can involve physical activity such as mime. Still, these games do not
                    require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of strength or stamina, or specialized
                    equipment other than what comes in a box.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="sub_content">
                <h3>Board games</h3>
                <p>Board games use as a central tool a board on which the players' status, resources, and progress are
                    tracked using physical tokens. Many also involve dice or cards. Most games that simulate war are
                    board games (though a large number of video games have been created to simulate strategic combat),
                    and the board may be a map on which the players' tokens move. Virtually all board games involve
                    "turn-based" play; one player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does the
                    same, and a player can only act on their turn. This is opposed to "real-time" play as is found in
                    some card games, most sports and most video games.</p>
                <p>Some games, such as chess and Go, are entirely deterministic, relying only on the strategy element
                    for their interest. Such games are usually described as having "perfect information"; the only
                    unknown is the exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any unknown event
                    inherent in the game (such as a card draw or die roll). Children's games, on the other hand, tend to
                    be very luck-based, with games such as Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders having virtually no
                    decisions to be made. By some definitions, such as that by Greg Costikyan, they are not games since
                    there are no decisions to make which affect the outcome. Many other games involving a high
                    degree of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event simply determines a
                    gain or loss in the standing of the current player within the game, which is independent of any
                    other player; the "game" then is actually a "race" by definitions such as Crawford's.</p>
